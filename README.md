This project is designed to take a long time, to keep me occupied over the mid-semester holidays.
It's a website for my own use that contains the most useful links and descriptions about some games and websites I like to use. 
Of course, on request of public demand I can add more sites connected to it.
Also I do want it to be asthetically pleasing
